Project Goals:
1. Predict the state of the game through time, including but not limited to
    1.1: the score of each alliance, attributed to each robot
    1.2: the rough position of each robot  
    1.3: Ranking Points
    1.4: State of the end game elements
    1.5: Phase of game: Autonomous vs TeleOp vs Endgame
2. Figure out how the robot properties influence the state of the game resulting 
in a sensitivity plot of how much each robot capability influences the state of the game.
 

Project Architecture:
I am going to be using an object oriented sim with a step wise, euler method based approach to 
moving the model through time, which should be fine because there isn't any derivative effects

I will be implementing the complexities of physics/robo capabilities in an order which balances the following 
(Subjective) factors, trying to get the "High-High-Low" things first
    - The expected impact on the results of the model
    - The value of each decision on our robot design
    - How hard it is to implement

The prioritization of the complications / features which get added will also be dictated by 

Physics / Robot Capabilities / Model complexities, in no paritcular order yet, I will later be prioritizing them 
according to the prioritization scheme outlined above
    - Accurate Time & Game Phase
    - Zone Structure for the game field
    - Robot Robot Picking up Notes
    - Robt scoring Notes
    - Robot reliability
    - "Traffic"
    - Ability to move under the stage vs needing to drive around it
    - 1 Robot playing a game by itself
    - 2 Robots playing each other
    - 2 Teams of 3 Robots playing each other
